## "I don't know what I did last PR":

### Compare commits

You can do it using the commit hash or branch name or mixing both in this link:

```
https://github.com/[YourProfile]/[YourRepo]/compare/[BaseCommitOrBranch]...[CommitOrBranchToCompare]
```

###### Using two hashes

For example, in my [Snake2077 repository](https://github.com/JulianRezende/Snake2077), I have the commits `52583305cfc73aca5dc1a12917126fba4db13489` (the first one) and `492176304d52183816384b566169420697867fed` (the last one), both in the master branch. To compare them, I use this link:

https://github.com/JulianRezende/Snake2077/compare/52583305cfc73aca5dc1a12917126fba4db13489..492176304d52183816384b566169420697867fed

###### Using two branches

I can also compare my master branch with my branch `gh-pages` (they're equal, so there's nothing to show in the comparison):

https://github.com/JulianRezende/Snake2077/compare/master...gh-pages

It's also valid to compare with a forked branch, like `master..AnotherAccount:master`

###### Using one commit and one branch

Last but not least, I can mix the hash with the branch:

https://github.com/JulianRezende/Snake2077/compare/52583305cfc73aca5dc1a12917126fba4db13489..master
